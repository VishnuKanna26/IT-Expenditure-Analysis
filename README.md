# IT-Expenditure-Analysis
This repository contains the source files and documentation for an IT Expenditure Analysis Dashboard built using Microsoft Power BI. 
The dashboard analyzes IT spending data, including actual, forecast, and planned costs, across various dimensions such as Business Area, Region, IT Area, and time periods. 
The project was developed step-by-step to ensure a robust data model and an intuitive, user-friendly interface for stakeholders.

The dataset, originally from IT Expenditure dataset.xlsx with two sheets (Data and Future Data), has been combined into a single table (IT_Expenditure_Combined) containing 93,740 rows of financial data. 
This table includes metrics like Actual, Forecast, Plan, and categorical fields such as Cost Element Group and IT Sub Area. The dashboard features interactive slicers, KPI cards, trend visualizations, and drilldown capabilities to support decision-making.

Features
Data Preparation: Combines and cleans the dataset into IT_Expenditure_Combined, handling missing values, duplicates, and data type conversions.
Cost Analysis: Calculates total spend, category-level breakdowns, and variances (e.g., Actual vs. Plan: -3.77%).
Trend Analysis: Visualizes monthly spend trends and regional/IT sub-area distributions.
Dashboard: A polished, interactive layout with slicers, cards, line charts, bar charts, treemaps, and matrices.
Interactivity: Includes drillthrough pages, bookmarks, and tooltips for deeper insights.

Prerequisites
